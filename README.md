# IPEN-engineering-cookbook

This repository contains the IPEN Cookbook for Privacy Engineering. The idea for this cookbook was launched at the [IPEN Workshop, September 26, 2014, Berlin](https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/lang/en/EDPS/IPEN/IPEN_Workshop).

Lead editor for this cookbook is Jaap-Henk Hoepman, jhh@cs.ru.nl.

[main.md](./main.md) is the entry point for this document. For the moment just dump your contributions in that file,. I will occasionally check whether some structuring (creating sections or splitting files) is necessary. Of course, feel free to create any structure you think is needed!
